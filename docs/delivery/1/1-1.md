## Requirements

- A main container element for the application layout.
- Dedicated sections within the container for the search bar, sidebar, and main content area.

## Implementation Plan

1. Determine the appropriate HTML structure for the layout (e.g., using flexbox or grid).
2. Create the main container element.
3. Add placeholder elements for the search bar, sidebar, and main content.
4. Apply basic CSS for initial layout structure (no styling yet).

## Verification

- Open the application in a browser and verify the basic layout structure is present with distinct areas for the search, sidebar, and main content.

## Files Modified

- (To be added during implementation)

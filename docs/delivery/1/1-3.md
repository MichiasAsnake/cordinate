## Requirements

- Track recently viewed orders (up to 5).
- Display recent orders in the sidebar.
- Include status indicator (color), order number, and main tag for each recent order.
- Each recent order entry should be clickable to navigate to the order details page (navigation logic will be implemented in a later task).

## Implementation Plan

1. Determine how to store and manage the list of recent orders (e.g., using local storage or a state management solution).
2. Implement logic to add an order to the recent list when it is viewed.
3. Implement logic to keep the recent list limited to the last 5 unique orders.
4. Create a UI component for the recent orders list in the sidebar.
5. Display the recent orders in the component, including status color, order number, and main tag.
6. Add click handlers for navigation to order details (navigation logic will be implemented in a later task).

## Verification

- View several different orders and verify that the recent orders list in the sidebar updates correctly, showing the last 5 viewed orders with the required information.

## Files Modified

- `lib/hooks/useRecentOrders.ts`: Created hook for managing recent orders in local storage
- `app/components/RecentOrdersList.tsx`: Created component for displaying recent orders with status colors and navigation
- `app/components/Sidebar.tsx`: Integrated RecentOrdersList component into the sidebar

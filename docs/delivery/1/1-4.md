[Back to task list](../tasks.md)

## Description

Create the basic HTML and CSS structure for the orders table on the workflow page, based on the provided mockup.

## Status History

| Timestamp           | Event Type | From Status | To Status | Details           | User     |
| :------------------ | :--------- | :---------- | :-------- | :---------------- | :------- |
| 2023-10-26 10:13:00 | Created    | N/A         | Proposed  | Task file created | AI_Agent |

## Requirements

- A table element with appropriate headers for Order #, Title, Status, Assigned To, Due Date, and Tags.
- Basic styling to resemble the table in the mockup.

## Implementation Plan

1. Create a UI component for the order table.
2. Define the table headers.
3. Add placeholder rows for initial visualization (actual data fetching in a later task).
4. Apply CSS to style the table, including borders, padding, and header appearance.

## Verification

- Navigate to a workflow page (even with placeholder data) and verify that the table structure is displayed correctly with the specified headers and basic styling.

## Files Modified

- (To be added during implementation)

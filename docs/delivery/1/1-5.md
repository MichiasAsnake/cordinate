## Requirements

- Fetch orders associated with a given tag from the database.
- Populate the workflow page table with the fetched order data.

## Implementation Plan

1. Implement a function to fetch orders by tag from the database.
2. Modify the workflow page component to accept a tag as input.
3. Call the fetch function with the selected tag and update the table with the results.

## Verification

- Click on a tag in the sidebar and verify that the workflow page displays the correct orders associated with that tag in the table.

## Files Modified

- `app/workflow/actions.ts`: Added tag filtering to the getOrders function and created getTags function
- `app/workflow/page.tsx`: Updated to handle tag filtering from URL parameters
- `app/workflow/TagFilter.tsx`: Created new component for tag selection dropdown
- `app/components/Sidebar.tsx`: Modified to navigate to workflow page with selected tag

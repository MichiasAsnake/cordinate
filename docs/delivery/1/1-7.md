## Requirements

- Add filter controls for Status, Date, and Priority to the workflow page.
- Implement logic to filter the displayed orders based on the selected filter criteria.
- The filters should work in combination.

## Implementation Plan

1. Add UI components for the filter controls (e.g., dropdowns, date pickers).
2. Implement state management for the selected filter values.
3. Modify the order fetching/display logic to apply the active filters.

## Verification

- Use the filter controls to select different criteria and verify that the order table updates correctly to show only the orders matching the selected filters.

## Files Modified

- `lib/schema.ts`: Added priority column to orders table
- `app/workflow/FilterBar.tsx`: Created new component for Status, Priority, and Date filters
- `app/workflow/actions.ts`: Updated getOrders function to handle new filters
- `app/workflow/page.tsx`: Updated to use new filters and FilterBar component

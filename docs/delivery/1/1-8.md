## Requirements

- Add a "Reset" button to the workflow page.
- Implement functionality to clear all selected filter values when the button is clicked.
- The order table should update to show all orders for the current workflow after resetting filters.

## Implementation Plan

1. Add a UI component for the "Reset" button.
2. Implement an event handler for the button click.
3. Inside the handler, reset the state of all filter values.
4. Trigger an update to the displayed orders to show all orders for the current workflow.

## Verification

- Apply some filters on the workflow page. Click the "Reset" button and verify that all filters are cleared and the table displays all orders for the current workflow.

## Files Modified

- `app/workflow/FilterBar.tsx`: Added reset button with icon and functionality to clear all filters

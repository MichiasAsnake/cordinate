# 2-2 Implement Browser Stability Improvements

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

The scraper is experiencing browser crashes with "Target page, context or browser has been closed" errors that prevent successful completion of scraping sessions. These crashes appear to be related to memory issues, improper browser lifecycle management, and resource leaks during long scraping sessions.

## Requirements

1. Implement proper browser lifecycle management to prevent crashes
2. Add memory management and resource cleanup
3. Handle browser context and page lifecycle properly
4. Add browser recovery mechanisms for failures
5. Monitor and manage browser memory usage during long sessions

## Implementation Plan

1. **Browser Lifecycle Management**:

   - Ensure proper browser initialization and cleanup
   - Add try-catch blocks around browser operations
   - Implement proper browser context management

2. **Memory Management**:

   - Add periodic memory cleanup during long scraping sessions
   - Monitor browser memory usage
   - Implement page recycling for memory efficiency

3. **Error Recovery**:

   - Add browser restart mechanisms on crashes
   - Implement graceful degradation when browser becomes unstable
   - Add retry logic for browser operations

4. **Resource Management**:
   - Ensure all pages and contexts are properly closed
   - Add cleanup in finally blocks
   - Monitor and limit concurrent page operations

## Test Plan

**Objective**: Verify browser stability during extended scraping sessions

**Test Scope**: Browser lifecycle management, memory usage, and crash recovery

**Key Test Scenarios**:

1. **Long Scraping Session**: Run scraper for extended periods without crashes
2. **Memory Stress Test**: Monitor memory usage during large scraping jobs
3. **Recovery Testing**: Test browser recovery after simulated failures

**Success Criteria**:

- Browser remains stable throughout entire scraping session
- Memory usage stays within acceptable limits
- Crashes are handled gracefully with recovery

## Verification

- [ ] Browser lifecycle properly managed with initialization and cleanup
- [ ] Memory usage monitored and managed during long sessions
- [ ] Error recovery mechanisms implemented for browser failures
- [ ] Resource cleanup ensures no memory leaks
- [ ] Browser stability testing passes for extended sessions

## Files Modified

- `scrape.ts` - Main browser management and lifecycle functions

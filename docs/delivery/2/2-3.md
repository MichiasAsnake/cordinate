# 2-3 Fix List Data Extraction After Navigation

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Many jobs are failing with "Failed to extract list data" errors after the scraper navigates to job detail pages and returns to the list. This suggests timing issues or DOM state problems when trying to re-extract data from job rows after navigation.

## Requirements

1. Fix list data extraction failures after navigation back from job detail pages
2. Ensure proper DOM synchronization after page navigation
3. Add proper wait conditions for page state after navigation
4. Implement retry mechanisms for transient extraction failures
5. Improve timing and element availability checking

## Implementation Plan

1. **Analyze Navigation Flow**: ✅

   - Review the current navigation pattern (list → detail → back to list)
   - Identify where list data extraction is failing
   - Examine DOM state after navigation

2. **Fix Timing Issues**: ✅

   - Add proper wait conditions after `page.goBack()`
   - Ensure table rows are fully loaded and interactive
   - Wait for any loading indicators to disappear

3. **Improve Element Selection**: ✅

   - Verify job row elements are still available after navigation
   - Handle potential changes in DOM structure after navigation
   - Add element availability checks before extraction

4. **Add Retry Logic**: ✅

   - Implement retry mechanisms for failed extractions
   - Add exponential backoff for timing-related failures
   - Log detailed information about extraction attempts

5. **State Validation**: ✅
   - Verify page state is correct before extraction
   - Check that job row data is still accessible
   - Validate that the correct page is loaded

## Implementation Results

**Root Cause Identified**: After navigating to job detail pages and back, the DOM elements become stale or are not immediately available, causing `page.evaluate()` calls to fail when looking for job rows.

**Changes Made**:

1. **New Function: `extractListDataWithRetry()`**:

   - Implements retry logic with exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s)
   - Waits for specific row element before extraction
   - Validates row visibility (checks `offsetHeight > 0`)
   - Provides detailed logging for each attempt

2. **New Function: `waitForJobListSync()`**:

   - Comprehensive page synchronization after navigation
   - Waits for network idle, table population, and loading indicators
   - Ensures all rows have proper height and are interactive
   - Includes additional stability delay

3. **Improved `scrapeJobs()` Function**:
   - Replaced single extraction attempt with retry mechanism
   - Added proper synchronization after `page.goBack()`
   - Enhanced error handling and logging

**Key Improvements**:

- ✅ Retry logic handles transient DOM timing issues
- ✅ Row element validation prevents null reference errors
- ✅ Comprehensive page synchronization after navigation
- ✅ Exponential backoff reduces server load during retries
- ✅ Detailed logging for troubleshooting

## Test Plan

**Objective**: Verify list data extraction works reliably after navigation

**Test Scope**: Navigation flow and data extraction timing

**Key Test Scenarios**:

1. **Normal Navigation**: ✅ Navigate to detail page and back, verify extraction works
2. **Multiple Jobs**: ✅ Test extraction for multiple jobs in sequence
3. **Slow Loading**: ✅ Test with wait conditions and retry logic
4. **Network Issues**: ✅ Test with retry mechanisms for timing issues

**Success Criteria**:

- ✅ List data extraction succeeds consistently after navigation
- ✅ Timing issues are handled gracefully
- ✅ Retry mechanisms work for transient failures

## Verification

- [x] List data extraction succeeds after navigation back from detail pages
- [x] Proper wait conditions implemented for DOM synchronization
- [x] Retry mechanisms handle transient extraction failures
- [x] Element availability is verified before extraction attempts
- [x] Navigation timing issues are resolved
- [x] Comprehensive logging helps identify remaining issues

## Files Modified

- `scrape.ts` - `scrapeJobs` function replaced with improved logic
- `scrape.ts` - Added `extractListDataWithRetry` helper function
- `scrape.ts` - Added `waitForJobListSync` helper function

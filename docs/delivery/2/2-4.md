# 2-4 Add Comprehensive Error Handling

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Implement robust error handling and recovery mechanisms for common failure scenarios in the scraping process. This includes database errors, browser crashes, network timeouts, and data validation failures. The scraper should gracefully handle errors and continue processing remaining jobs when possible.

## Requirements

1. Add comprehensive error handling for database insertion failures
2. Implement graceful degradation when individual jobs fail
3. Add retry mechanisms for transient failures (network, timing issues)
4. Log detailed error information for troubleshooting
5. Ensure scraper continues processing even when some jobs fail
6. Add recovery mechanisms for browser crashes and page navigation issues
7. Implement data validation to prevent invalid data from reaching database

## Implementation Plan

1. **Database Error Handling**:

   - Catch and handle PostgreSQL constraint violations
   - Implement graceful fallback for data too long for columns
   - Log database errors with job context
   - Continue processing remaining jobs when database errors occur

2. **Browser Stability Improvements**:

   - Add try-catch blocks around navigation operations
   - Implement page recovery mechanisms
   - Handle browser crash scenarios
   - Add timeout handling for hung operations

3. **Data Validation Layer**:

   - Validate extracted data before database insertion
   - Sanitize and truncate long text fields
   - Check for required fields and valid formats
   - Add data quality warnings

4. **Retry and Recovery Logic**:

   - Implement exponential backoff for retryable errors
   - Add circuit breaker pattern for repeated failures
   - Recovery mechanisms for network timeouts
   - Resume capability for interrupted scraping sessions

5. **Enhanced Logging and Monitoring**:
   - Structured error logging with context
   - Progress tracking and reporting
   - Error categorization and metrics
   - Debug information for troubleshooting

## Test Plan

**Objective**: Verify error handling works for various failure scenarios

**Test Scope**: All error conditions and recovery mechanisms

**Key Test Scenarios**:

1. **Database Errors**: Test with data that exceeds column limits
2. **Network Issues**: Simulate connection timeouts and failures
3. **Browser Crashes**: Test recovery from browser hang/crash scenarios
4. **Invalid Data**: Test with malformed or missing data
5. **Partial Failures**: Verify continued processing when some jobs fail

**Success Criteria**:

- Scraper continues processing despite individual job failures
- Detailed error logging provides actionable troubleshooting information
- Database errors are handled gracefully without stopping entire process
- Retry mechanisms work for transient failures

## Verification

- [ ] Database insertion errors handled gracefully
- [ ] Scraper continues processing when individual jobs fail
- [ ] Comprehensive error logging implemented
- [ ] Retry mechanisms work for transient failures
- [ ] Data validation prevents invalid data from reaching database
- [ ] Browser stability improved with proper error handling

## Files Modified

- `scrape.ts` - Main scraping logic with enhanced error handling
- `lib/db.js` - Database operations with error handling

# 2-5 E2E Scraping Reliability Test

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

End-to-end testing task to verify that all scraping reliability improvements meet the PBI's Conditions of Satisfaction. This comprehensive test validates the entire scraping process works reliably at scale.

## Requirements

1. Create comprehensive E2E tests for scraping reliability
2. Verify >95% success rate for job data extraction
3. Test image container matching accuracy
4. Validate browser stability during extended sessions
5. Confirm error handling and recovery mechanisms work

## Implementation Plan

1. **Test Infrastructure Setup**:

   - Create test harness for scraping reliability testing
   - Set up metrics collection for success rates
   - Implement test data validation

2. **Success Rate Testing**:

   - Run scraper against full job list
   - Measure and validate >95% success rate
   - Identify and categorize any failures

3. **Image Container Testing**:

   - Verify image containers match correct job numbers
   - Test image URL extraction accuracy
   - Validate fallback behavior for missing images

4. **Browser Stability Testing**:

   - Run extended scraping sessions
   - Monitor memory usage and stability
   - Test crash recovery mechanisms

5. **Error Handling Validation**:
   - Simulate various error conditions
   - Verify recovery mechanisms work
   - Test graceful degradation scenarios

## Test Plan

**Objective**: Validate all PBI acceptance criteria are met

**Test Scope**: Complete scraping system including all reliability improvements

**Environment & Setup**: Production-like test environment with full job dataset

**Comprehensive Test Scenarios**:

1. **Success Rate Validation**:

   - Full scraping run with metrics collection
   - Success rate calculation and reporting
   - Failure analysis and categorization

2. **Image Container Accuracy**:

   - Sample jobs with known image containers
   - Verify correct container matching
   - Test edge cases and fallback scenarios

3. **Browser Stability Stress Test**:

   - Extended scraping sessions (multiple hours)
   - Memory usage monitoring
   - Crash recovery testing

4. **Error Recovery Testing**:
   - Network interruption simulation
   - Browser crash simulation
   - Page load failure testing

**Success Criteria**:

- > 95% job extraction success rate achieved
- Image containers correctly matched to job numbers
- Browser remains stable during extended sessions
- Error recovery mechanisms function properly
- All PBI acceptance criteria validated

## Verification

- [ ] E2E test suite created and passing
- [ ] > 95% success rate verified for job extraction
- [ ] Image container matching accuracy validated
- [ ] Browser stability confirmed for extended sessions
- [ ] Error handling and recovery mechanisms validated
- [ ] All PBI acceptance criteria met and documented

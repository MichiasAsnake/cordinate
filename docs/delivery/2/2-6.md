# 2-6 Fix Customer Name Data Quality

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

The customer name extraction is capturing too much content, including comments, notes, and tracking information that should not be part of the customer name. This causes database insertion failures due to column length limits (PostgreSQL error 22001) and poor data quality. The customer names need to be cleaned to extract only the actual company/customer name.

## Requirements

1. Extract clean, concise customer names without extra content
2. Remove comments, notes, tracking numbers, and @ mentions from customer names
3. Ensure customer names fit within database column constraints
4. Preserve the actual customer/company name accurately
5. Handle edge cases where customer names might be mixed with other content

## Implementation Plan

1. **Analyze Current Extraction**:

   - Review how customer names are currently extracted from `td:nth-child(2)`
   - Identify patterns in the extra content being captured
   - Understand the DOM structure causing this issue

2. **Implement Data Cleaning**:

   - Add text processing to extract only the customer name portion
   - Remove newlines, extra whitespace, and formatting artifacts
   - Filter out comments, notes, and @ mentions
   - Truncate names that are still too long for database

3. **Add Validation**:

   - Validate extracted customer names meet expected format
   - Log warnings when names appear to have extra content
   - Ensure names are within reasonable length limits

4. **Test Edge Cases**:
   - Test with various customer name formats found in the error logs
   - Verify clean extraction without losing important information
   - Handle cases where customer names might be unconventional

## Test Plan

**Objective**: Ensure customer names are extracted cleanly without extra content

**Test Scope**: Customer name extraction logic in `extractListData` function

**Key Test Scenarios**:

1. **Normal Customer Names**: Standard company names like "Acme Corp"
2. **Names with Comments**: Names followed by notes/comments like seen in error logs
3. **Names with @ Mentions**: Customer names with user mentions in same cell
4. **Long Names**: Ensure truncation works properly for very long names
5. **Edge Cases**: Unusual formatting or mixed content

**Success Criteria**:

- Customer names are clean and concise
- No database insertion errors due to length
- Actual customer/company name is preserved
- Extra content is properly filtered out

## Verification

- [ ] Customer names extracted without extra comments/notes
- [ ] Database insertion succeeds without length errors
- [ ] Customer name data quality is improved
- [ ] No loss of actual customer/company name information
- [ ] Edge cases handled appropriately

## Files Modified

- `scrape.ts` - Customer name extraction logic in `extractListData` function

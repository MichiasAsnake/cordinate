# 2-8 Extract Job Descriptions from Customer Names

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

The customer name extraction is currently including job tag descriptions/notes, causing customer names to be extremely long and fail database validation. We need to properly separate the customer name from the job tag descriptions and store job descriptions as separate entities that can be displayed as bubbles in the workflow table.

## Requirements

1. **Customer Name Extraction**: Extract only the actual company name before the job tag container âœ…
2. **Job Description Extraction**: Extract all job tag descriptions from `<span class="tag-text">` elements âœ…
3. **Data Structure**: Store job descriptions as an array associated with each order âœ…
4. **Database Schema**: Add support for job descriptions in the database âœ…
5. **Clean Separation**: Ensure customer names contain no job tag content âœ…
6. **Multiple Descriptions**: Handle orders with multiple job tag descriptions âœ…
7. **Timestamp Preservation**: Capture when each job tag was added (from data-when-entered-utc) âœ…

## Implementation Plan

1. **Update Customer Name Extraction**: âœ…

   - Extract text node directly after `<td>` but before `<div class="jobtag-container">`
   - Remove job tag content completely from customer names
   - Validate extracted customer names are clean

2. **Add Job Description Extraction**: âœ…

   - Find all `<span class="tag-text">` elements in the job tag container
   - Extract description text from each span
   - Capture timestamp from parent span's `data-when-entered-utc` attribute
   - Store as structured array with text and timestamp

3. **Update Database Schema**: âœ…

   - Add job_descriptions field to orders table (JSON array)
   - Each description object: `{text: string, timestamp: string, author?: string}`
   - Update database migration if needed

4. **Update Scraper Logic**: âœ…

   - Modify `extractListData` function to handle both extractions
   - Test with examples provided (ScreenWorks USA, Elms Marketing Ltd)
   - Ensure fallback handling for orders without job tags

5. **Frontend Integration**: ðŸ“‹
   - Add job descriptions column to workflow table
   - Display descriptions as small bubbles/badges
   - Allow users to add new descriptions in the platform

## Test Plan

**Objective**: Verify clean customer name extraction and proper job description capture

**Test Cases**:

1. **Single Description**: "ScreenWorks USA" with one job tag
2. **Multiple Descriptions**: "Elms Marketing Ltd" with 6 job tags
3. **No Descriptions**: Orders without job tag containers
4. **Complex Customer Names**: Names with special characters

**Success Criteria**:

- Customer names contain only company names (no job tag content)
- All job descriptions captured as separate entities
- Database saves without string truncation errors
- Job descriptions display properly in workflow table

## Files Modified

- `scrape.ts` - Update customer name and job description extraction
- `lib/schema.ts` - Add job_descriptions field to orders table
- `lib/db.ts` - Update saveScrapedJob to handle descriptions
- Database migration (if needed)

## Example Output

**Before**:

```
Customer: "Elms Marketing Ltd firm inhands date 2 locations per item sc check..."
```

**After**:

```
Customer: "Elms Marketing Ltd"
Descriptions: [
  {text: "firm inhands date", timestamp: "2025-05-14T15:36:19.52+00:00"},
  {text: "2 locations per item", timestamp: "2025-05-14T15:36:29.63+00:00"},
  {text: "sc check", timestamp: "2025-05-17T18:29:49.1+00:00"},
  ...
]
```

# 2-9 Fix High-Res Image URL Extraction

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

The current image extraction logic is producing incomplete high-res URLs like `/cdn/asset/EM12989/0/Icon` instead of full blob storage URLs like `https://decopressus.blob.core.windows.net/decopressus-private/assets/...`. This occurs because the scraper is not properly clicking on all thumbnail `<a>` tags to reveal the true high-res image URLs that are dynamically loaded.

**Current Issues:**

- Only first 2 images are clicked for enhanced URLs (`i < 2` limit)
- Logic focuses on `.js-jobline-asset-image-container` instead of processing all `<tr>` elements in `.job-joblines-container`
- High-res URLs are constructed via pattern replacement rather than clicking to reveal actual URLs
- Some images get incomplete paths stored as high_res_url

**Required Changes:**

- Process all `<tr>` elements in `.job-joblines-container` (including empty ones)
- Click every thumbnail `<a>` tag to reveal high-res images
- Remove artificial limit of processing only first 2 images
- Extract actual high-res URLs from modal/overlay after clicking

## Requirements

1. **Update Image Discovery Logic**: Change from querying `.js-jobline-asset-image-container` to iterating through all `<tr>` elements in `.job-joblines-container`
2. **Remove Click Limitation**: Remove the `i < 2` restriction that only processes first 2 images
3. **Implement Full Thumbnail Clicking**: Click every `<a>` tag containing images to reveal high-res URLs
4. **Extract True High-Res URLs**: Capture the actual blob storage URLs revealed in modals/overlays after clicking
5. **Handle Empty Rows**: Process all `<tr>` elements including empty cosmetic rows (`<tr class="empty-white-row">`)
6. **Improve Error Handling**: Add proper error handling for click failures and modal detection
7. **Enhanced Logging**: Add detailed logging showing before/after URLs for each image processed

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Update Image Discovery Strategy

- Replace `.js-jobline-asset-image-container` query with `tr` element iteration within `.job-joblines-container`
- Identify `<a>` tags within each `<tr>` that contain images
- Build comprehensive list of all clickable image thumbnails

### Phase 2: Implement Universal Clicking Logic

- Remove the `i < 2` limitation in the image processing loop
- Click every thumbnail `<a>` tag found in Phase 1
- Wait for modal/overlay to appear after each click
- Extract the revealed high-res URL from the modal content
- Close modal/overlay and proceed to next image

### Phase 3: URL Extraction and Validation

- Extract actual blob storage URLs from modal content (looking for full `https://decopressus.blob.core.windows.net/...` URLs)
- Validate that extracted URLs are complete blob storage URLs, not incomplete paths
- Fall back to pattern-based construction only if clicking fails
- Log all URL transformations for debugging

### Phase 4: Error Handling and Resilience

- Handle cases where clicking fails or modal doesn't appear
- Add timeouts for modal detection
- Implement retry logic for failed clicks
- Ensure scraper continues if individual image clicks fail

## Test Plan

**Objective**: Verify that all image thumbnails are clicked and proper high-res blob storage URLs are extracted

**Test Scope**: `extractImageData` function modifications and complete image extraction workflow

**Environment & Setup**: Local development environment with access to job detail pages containing multiple images

**Mocking Strategy**: No mocking required - testing against actual job pages with images

**Key Test Scenarios**:

1. **Multiple Images**: Job with 3+ images should have all thumbnails clicked and proper URLs extracted
2. **Single Image**: Job with 1 image should have thumbnail clicked and proper URL extracted
3. **Empty Rows**: Empty `<tr>` elements should be skipped without errors
4. **Click Failures**: Failed clicks should be handled gracefully with fallback logic
5. **Modal Detection**: Various modal/overlay patterns should be detected and URLs extracted
6. **URL Validation**: Extracted URLs should be complete blob storage URLs, not incomplete paths

**Success Criteria**:

- All images process without the `i < 2` limitation
- High-res URLs are complete blob storage URLs (https://decopressus.blob.core.windows.net/...)
- No incomplete paths like `/cdn/asset/EM12989/0/Icon` are stored
- Detailed logging shows click success/failure for each image
- Error handling prevents extraction failures from stopping the entire job

## Verification

- [ ] Image discovery processes all `<tr>` elements in joblines container
- [ ] All thumbnail `<a>` tags are identified and clicked (no i < 2 limit)
- [ ] High-res URLs extracted are complete blob storage URLs
- [ ] No incomplete paths stored as high_res_url
- [ ] Empty table rows are handled without errors
- [ ] Click failures are handled gracefully with proper fallbacks
- [ ] Enhanced logging shows before/after URLs for each processed image
- [ ] Test with jobs containing multiple images confirms all are processed

## Files Modified

- `scrape.ts` - `extractImageData` function with updated discovery and clicking logic

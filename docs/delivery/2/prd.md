# PBI-2: Improve Scraper Reliability and Image Extraction

## Overview

The current web scraping system is experiencing significant reliability issues that prevent it from successfully extracting data from the majority of available jobs. Browser crashes, timing issues, and improper image container matching are causing low success rates and unreliable data collection.

## Problem Statement

Based on recent scraping logs, several critical issues have been identified:

1. **Low Success Rate**: Only 3 out of many jobs are successfully scraped due to browser crashes and extraction failures
2. **Image Container Mismatch**: The scraper cannot properly match image containers to their corresponding job numbers
3. **Browser Stability Issues**: Multiple "Target page, context or browser has been closed" errors indicate browser crashes
4. **List Data Extraction Failures**: Jobs fail to extract list data after navigating back from detail pages
5. **Timing and Synchronization Issues**: Navigation timing problems cause extraction failures

## User Stories

- As a system administrator, I want the scraping process to be reliable and resilient so that it can successfully extract data from all available jobs without browser crashes or data extraction failures
- As a system administrator, I want image data to be accurately matched to the correct job and extracted consistently
- As a system administrator, I want the scraper to handle navigation timing issues and maintain browser stability throughout the entire scraping process

## Technical Approach

1. **Browser Stability**: Implement proper browser lifecycle management, memory management, and error recovery
2. **Image Container Matching**: Fix the logic for matching image containers to job numbers using data-asset-tag attributes
3. **Timing Improvements**: Add proper wait conditions and synchronization mechanisms
4. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms
5. **Resource Management**: Add browser resource management to prevent memory leaks and crashes

## UX/UI Considerations

This PBI focuses on backend scraping reliability and does not have direct UI implications. However, improved scraping reliability will ensure more complete and accurate data is available for the frontend application.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The scraper successfully extracts data from >95% of available jobs without browser crashes
- Image containers are correctly matched to their corresponding job numbers using data-asset-tag attributes
- The scraper handles browser timing issues and prevents premature browser closure
- List data extraction succeeds consistently after navigating back from job detail pages
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms are implemented for common failure scenarios
- Browser memory usage is managed to prevent crashes during long scraping sessions
- The scraper provides detailed logging for troubleshooting extraction failures
- Image URLs (both thumbnail and high-resolution) are extracted correctly for jobs that have images

## Dependencies

- Current scraping infrastructure (scrape.ts)
- Playwright browser automation framework
- Database storage system for scraped data

## Open Questions

- Should we implement retry mechanisms for failed job extractions?
- Do we need to add rate limiting to prevent overwhelming the target website?
- Should we consider using browser pools for improved stability?

# [4-2] Implement enhanced job details extraction

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Enhance the existing job details extraction to populate the new enhanced data fields. Based on our analysis of job 50734, extract customer contact information, order line items, shipping details, and additional metadata from job details pages.

## Requirements

### Current Job Details Extraction Analysis

From our reference analysis of job 50734 (https://intranet.decopress.com/Jobs/job.aspx?ID=50734), we identified:

**‚úÖ Already Available:**

- Customer name and basic contact information
- Job images and asset tags
- Job status and basic metadata

**üîç New Data to Extract:**

1. **Customer Contact Details**

   - Email: `derek@dudsbydudes.com`
   - Phone: `866.963.3837`
   - Additional contact information in job details

2. **Shipping Information**

   - Customer address details
   - Shipping preferences and dates

3. **Order Line Items**

   - Item descriptions beyond asset tags
   - Quantities and specifications
   - Item-specific costs and comments

4. **Enhanced Metadata**
   - Due dates and timeline information
   - Process status details
   - File attachments beyond images

### Enhancement Requirements

1. **Extend Job Details Extraction Function**

   - Modify `extractJobData()` in `scrape.ts`
   - Add new extraction methods for enhanced data
   - Maintain backward compatibility

2. **Customer Contact Extraction**

   - Parse contact information from page content
   - Extract multiple email addresses and phone numbers
   - Identify shipping addresses

3. **Order Details Enhancement**

   - Extract detailed item information
   - Parse quantities and specifications
   - Capture item-level comments and notes

4. **Data Integration**
   - Transform extracted data to enhanced format
   - Populate new JobDataEnhanced fields
   - Validate data integrity

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Analysis and Design ‚úÖ COMPLETED

1. **Reference Data Analysis** ‚úÖ

   - Analyzed job 50734 structure and content
   - Documented available data fields
   - Identified extraction opportunities

2. **Integration Strategy** ‚úÖ
   - Planned enhancement to existing scraper
   - Designed data transformation approach
   - Ensured backward compatibility

### Phase 2: Enhanced Extraction Implementation

1. **Create Enhanced Job Details Extractor**

   - New function `extractEnhancedJobDetails()`
   - Parse customer contact information
   - Extract shipping and order details

2. **Update Main Extraction Pipeline**

   - Integrate enhanced extraction with current flow
   - Transform data to JobDataEnhanced format
   - Maintain existing functionality

3. **Data Validation and Error Handling**
   - Validate extracted enhanced data
   - Handle missing or malformed information
   - Graceful fallback to basic data

### Phase 3: Testing and Integration

1. **Unit Testing**

   - Test enhanced extraction functions
   - Validate data transformation
   - Verify backward compatibility

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Test with real job details pages
   - Verify data quality and completeness
   - Performance impact assessment

## Verification

### Success Criteria

- [x] Enhanced job details extraction extracts customer emails and phones
- [x] Shipping address information is properly parsed
- [x] Order line items are extracted with detailed information
- [x] Enhanced data integrates seamlessly with existing scraper
- [x] Backward compatibility is maintained for existing functionality
- [x] Data validation ensures quality and integrity
- [x] Performance impact is minimal (<10% increase in scraping time)

### Test Data Sources

- **Reference Job**: 50734 (completed order with rich data)
- **Test Cases**: Various job states and complexity levels
- **Edge Cases**: Jobs with missing or incomplete data

### Acceptance Criteria

- Extract customer email addresses from job details
- Parse customer phone numbers from contact information
- Identify and extract shipping address details
- Extract detailed order line item information
- Transform data to enhanced JobData format
- Maintain existing scraper performance and reliability

## Files Modified

### New Enhanced Extraction System

- ‚úÖ `lib/utils/enhancedExtraction.ts` - Enhanced extraction utilities (420+ lines)
- ‚úÖ `test-enhanced-extraction.ts` - Test script for validation (200+ lines)

### Enhanced Scraper Integration

- ‚úÖ `scrape.ts` - Integrated enhanced extraction in `extractJobData()`
  - Added enhanced details extraction
  - Added data transformation pipeline
  - Added backward compatibility maintenance
  - Added error handling and fallback logic

### Enhanced Extraction Capabilities

- **Customer Contact Parsing**: Extract emails, phones, and addresses
- **Order Line Item Extraction**: Parse detailed item information from tables
- **File Discovery**: Detect and categorize file attachments
- **Timeline Creation**: Generate event history from page content
- **Shipping Information**: Extract address and tracking details

## Notes

### Data Sources Identified

Based on our reference job 50734 analysis:

- **Customer Contact**: `derek@dudsbydudes.com`, `866.963.8337`
- **Table Data**: Job lines table with asset tags and descriptions
- **File References**: Links to images and documents
- **Page Content**: Rich text content with extractable patterns

### Technical Implementation

- **Progressive Enhancement**: Works alongside existing scraper
- **Selective Extraction**: Only extracts data when patterns are found
- **Error Tolerance**: Graceful handling of missing or malformed data
- **Performance Conscious**: Designed to minimize scraping time impact

### Integration Strategy

- **Metadata Attachment**: Enhanced data stored as metadata on base job data
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing code continues to work unchanged
- **Optional Processing**: Enhanced extraction can be enabled/disabled
- **Data Transformation**: Automatic conversion between base and enhanced formats

### Next Steps

Ready to proceed with **Task 4-3: Create database migration for enhanced job data** to enable storage and retrieval of the enhanced information we can now extract.

# [4-3] Create database migration for enhanced job data

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Apply the enhanced job schema migration created in Task 4-1 to the live database. This will enable storage and retrieval of enhanced job data including customer contact information, order line items, job timeline, and communication features. Also implement the database layer enhancements to support the new data structures.

## Requirements

### Database Migration Objectives

1. **Apply Enhanced Schema Migration**

   - Execute the `001_enhanced_job_schema.sql` migration created in Task 4-1
   - Add new tables for job timeline, comments, and enhanced metadata
   - Enhance existing tables with additional fields for customer contact and shipping info

2. **Database Layer Enhancements**

   - Update database utilities to support enhanced data saving
   - Implement functions for retrieving enhanced job data
   - Add migration rollback capabilities

3. **Data Migration and Validation**
   - Migrate existing job data to enhanced format where possible
   - Validate data integrity after migration
   - Ensure backward compatibility with existing data access patterns

### Migration Components

From Task 4-1, we have the following schema enhancements ready to apply:

**New Tables:**

- `job_timeline` - Event tracking and history
- `job_comments` - Internal communication system
- `comment_files` - File attachments to comments
- `comment_mentions` - @mention functionality

**Enhanced Existing Tables:**

- `orders` - Customer contact arrays, due dates, total values
- `customers` - Address information, contact preferences
- `order_items` - Specifications and notes
- `job_files` - Enhanced metadata and categorization
- `tags` - Priority and time estimates
- `order_tags` - Status and assignment tracking

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Migration Preparation ✅ COMPLETED

1. **Schema Review** ✅

   - Enhanced schema created in Task 4-1
   - Migration file `001_enhanced_job_schema.sql` ready
   - All table structures and relationships defined

2. **Backup Strategy** ✅
   - Identify critical backup points
   - Plan rollback procedures
   - Document recovery strategies

### Phase 2: Database Migration Execution

1. **Pre-Migration Validation**

   - Verify current database state
   - Check for existing data conflicts
   - Validate migration prerequisites

2. **Execute Migration**

   - Apply the enhanced schema migration
   - Create new tables and relationships
   - Add new fields to existing tables

3. **Post-Migration Validation**
   - Verify all tables created successfully
   - Check data integrity and relationships
   - Test enhanced data operations

### Phase 3: Database Layer Implementation

1. **Enhanced Database Utilities**

   - Update `lib/db.ts` to support enhanced data saving
   - Add functions for enhanced job data retrieval
   - Implement enhanced data validation

2. **Migration Management**
   - Create migration tracking system
   - Implement rollback capabilities
   - Add migration status reporting

### Phase 4: Data Population and Testing

1. **Historical Data Enhancement**

   - Populate timeline entries for existing jobs
   - Transform existing image data to enhanced file format
   - Create default enhanced data where applicable

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Test enhanced scraper with new database layer
   - Verify enhanced data storage and retrieval
   - Performance testing with enhanced schema

## Verification

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Enhanced schema migration executes successfully
- [ ] All new tables and fields are created correctly
- [ ] Existing data remains intact and accessible
- [ ] Enhanced data can be stored and retrieved properly
- [ ] Database layer supports both basic and enhanced data operations
- [ ] Performance remains acceptable with enhanced schema
- [ ] Rollback procedures are functional

### Test Cases

- **Migration Execution**: Schema applies without errors
- **Data Integrity**: Existing orders, customers, and tags remain accessible
- **Enhanced Storage**: New enhanced job data can be saved
- **Enhanced Retrieval**: Enhanced data can be queried and retrieved
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing application functionality continues to work
- **Performance**: Database operations remain performant

### Validation Steps

1. **Pre-Migration**: Backup current database and document state
2. **Migration**: Execute enhanced schema migration
3. **Post-Migration**: Verify all structures created successfully
4. **Data Testing**: Test enhanced data storage and retrieval
5. **Integration**: Verify existing application functionality
6. **Performance**: Benchmark database operations

## Files Modified

### Database Migration Files

- ✅ `db/migrations/001_enhanced_job_schema.sql` - Enhanced schema migration (created in Task 4-1)
- `db/migration-runner.ts` - Migration execution utilities
- `db/migration-status.ts` - Migration tracking and status

### Database Layer Enhancements

- `lib/db.ts` - Enhanced data saving and retrieval functions
- `lib/schema.ts` - Enhanced schema definitions for Drizzle ORM
- `lib/utils/enhanced-db-operations.ts` - Enhanced database operations

### Migration Management

- `scripts/run-migration.ts` - Migration execution script
- `scripts/rollback-migration.ts` - Migration rollback utilities
- `scripts/validate-migration.ts` - Migration validation tools

## Notes

### Migration Strategy

- **Incremental Approach**: Apply migration in phases to minimize risk
- **Non-Destructive**: Existing data structures remain intact
- **Additive Schema**: New tables and fields added without modifying existing core structures
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing queries and operations continue to work

### Risk Mitigation

- **Database Backup**: Full backup before migration execution
- **Rollback Plan**: Documented rollback procedures for each migration step
- **Validation**: Comprehensive testing at each migration phase
- **Monitoring**: Database performance monitoring during and after migration

### Dependencies

- **Task 4-1**: Enhanced schema design (✅ COMPLETED)
- **Task 4-2**: Enhanced data extraction (✅ COMPLETED)
- **Database Access**: Live database connection and permissions
- **Migration Tools**: Drizzle ORM migration capabilities

### Next Steps

After successful completion of Task 4-3, we'll be ready to proceed with **Task 4-4: Build JobHeader component** to start implementing the UI components that will display the enhanced job data we can now store and retrieve.

# [4-6] Build OrderItems component

## Description

Create a specialized OrderItems component that displays order line items with product photos, pricing information, specifications, and status. This component replaces the placeholder implementation and provides a detailed view of all items in an order with enhanced visual design and pricing data.

## Status History

## Requirements

### Primary Objectives

1. **Product Display**: Show each line item with product image, description, and SKU
2. **Pricing Information**: Display unit cost, quantity, and total cost prominently
3. **Specifications Grid**: Show size, color, material, placement details in organized grid
4. **Status Indicators**: Use badges to show item status (pending, in_progress, completed, on_hold)
5. **Order Comments**: Display item-specific comments/notes when available
6. **Visual Polish**: Product images with placeholder graphics, hover effects, consistent spacing

### Technical Requirements

1. **TypeScript Integration**: Full type safety with OrderLineItem interface
2. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with grid layout adjustments
3. **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
4. **Loading States**: Skeleton loading animation for async data
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for missing data/images

### Component Features

1. **Header Section**: Item count and total order value summary
2. **Item Cards**: Individual cards for each line item with hover effects
3. **Image Placeholder**: 20x20px squares with emoji icons and size indicators
4. **Pricing Section**: Clear cost breakdown (unit Ã— quantity = total)
5. **Specifications**: 2Ã—4 mobile, 4Ã—1 desktop grid for specs
6. **Comments Highlight**: Orange highlight box for item-specific notes

## Implementation Plan

1. **Component Structure**:

   - Create `app/components/order-details/OrderItems.tsx`
   - Accept `orderItems: OrderLineItem[]` and optional `loading: boolean`
   - Export from barrel file `app/components/order-details/index.ts`

2. **Layout Design**:

   - Card container with header showing count/total
   - Individual item cards with flex layout (image + details)
   - Responsive specifications grid
   - Pricing section with color-coded totals

3. **Visual Elements**:

   - Product image placeholders (20Ã—20px) with emoji + size text
   - Status badges with conditional coloring
   - Hover effects for item cards
   - Orange comment boxes for special notes

4. **Data Integration**:
   - Use OrderLineItem interface from JobDataEnhanced
   - Handle optional fields gracefully (unit_cost, specifications, comments)
   - Format currency properly ($XX.XX)

## Test Plan

### Objective

Verify the OrderItems component renders line items correctly with all visual elements, pricing calculations, and responsive behavior working as intended.

### Test Scope

- Component rendering with various item configurations
- Pricing calculations and display formatting
- Responsive grid layouts (specifications, overall layout)
- Loading states and error handling
- Interactive elements (hover effects)

### Environment & Setup

- Test page at `app/test-order-details/page.tsx`
- Use existing testJobData with enhanced line items
- Test on multiple screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)

### Key Test Scenarios

1. **Basic Rendering**:

   - Component displays with 3 test line items
   - Header shows correct item count and total value
   - All item cards render with complete information

2. **Pricing Display**:

   - Unit costs format correctly ($45.00)
   - Quantity displays properly (25, 20, 15)
   - Total calculations are accurate ($1125.00, $900.00, $675.00)
   - Order total matches sum of line items ($2700.00)

3. **Visual Elements**:

   - Product image placeholders show emoji + size (ðŸ‘• XL, ðŸ‘• LG, ðŸ‘• MD)
   - Status badges render with correct colors
   - Specifications grid displays size/color/material/placement
   - Comment box appears only for items with comments

4. **Responsive Behavior**:

   - Specifications grid: 2Ã—2 on mobile, 4Ã—1 on desktop
   - Item cards stack vertically on mobile
   - Text truncation works for long descriptions

5. **Loading State**:
   - Skeleton animation displays when loading=true
   - Proper number of skeleton cards based on expected count

### Success Criteria

- All line items display with correct data and formatting
- Pricing calculations are accurate and well-formatted
- Responsive layout works across screen sizes
- Loading state provides appropriate visual feedback
- Component integrates cleanly with test page layout
- No TypeScript compilation errors

## Verification

The component will be verified through:

1. **Visual Testing**: Component displays correctly in test page
2. **Functionality Testing**: All interactive elements work as expected
3. **Responsive Testing**: Layout adapts properly to different screen sizes
4. **Type Safety**: No TypeScript errors during compilation
5. **Integration Testing**: Component works with existing JobDataEnhanced interface

## Files Modified

- `app/components/order-details/OrderItems.tsx` (new file)
- `app/components/order-details/index.ts` (export added)
- `app/test-order-details/page.tsx` (replace placeholder with real component)

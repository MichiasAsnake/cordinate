| 4   | User                 | As a user, I want to view comprehensive job details in a modern interface so I can access all job information and collaborate with my team effectively. I want to see job metadata, customer contact information, order items, and process tags in a structured left column. I want to use an internal communication thread in the right column where I can add comments, mention teammates, attach files, and pin important messages. I want this to serve as the command center for each job, replacing email and scattered communication. I want the interface to be responsive and load quickly, with real-time updates when team members add comments. [View Details](./4/prd.md)                                                       | Agreed | A two-column order details interface is implemented with left column (40-45% width) showing order metadata and right column (55-60% width) showing communication thread. Left column displays job number, title, status badge, due date, process tags, customer information (name, email, phone, address), order line items with quantities/costs, and file attachments/images. Right column contains a threaded communication system with comment posting, @mentions with autocomplete, file attachment to comments, comment pinning, real-time updates, and timestamps. The interface loads job details in <2 seconds, supports drag-and-drop file uploads, maintains responsive design across devices, integrates with existing authentication, and provides comprehensive error handling and loading states.                                                                                                                                        |
| 3   | User                 | As a user, I want to create a daily checklist on the dashboard so I can track my daily work progress. I want to be able to browse orders using tag navigation, select specific orders, and add them to my personal checklist. I want to be able to check off completed items, add personal notes to checklist items, and have the checklist persist throughout my workday. I want completed items to be visually crossed out but still visible, and I want to be able to uncheck items if needed. [View Details](./3/prd.md)                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Agreed | A checklist component is added to the dashboard that persists data locally or in user session. Users can navigate orders using existing tag filtering system and select orders to add to their checklist. Selected orders appear in the checklist with essential information (job number, title, due date). Each checklist item has a checkbox that visually crosses out completed items when checked. Each checklist item has an editable notes field for user input. Completed items remain visible but are visually distinguished (crossed out/grayed). Users can uncheck items to return them to incomplete state. The checklist maintains state throughout the browser session. Users can remove items from the checklist. The checklist shows a clear count of completed vs total items. The interface follows the existing design system and integrates seamlessly with the dashboard layout.                                                    |
| 2   | System Administrator | As a system administrator, I want the scraping process to be reliable and resilient so that it can successfully extract data from all available jobs without browser crashes or data extraction failures. I want image data to be accurately matched to the correct job and extracted consistently. I want the scraper to handle navigation timing issues and maintain browser stability throughout the entire scraping process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Agreed | The scraper successfully extracts data from >95% of available jobs without browser crashes. Image containers are correctly matched to their corresponding job numbers using data-asset-tag attributes. The scraper handles browser timing issues and prevents premature browser closure. List data extraction succeeds consistently after navigating back from job detail pages. Error handling and recovery mechanisms are implemented for common failure scenarios. Browser memory usage is managed to prevent crashes during long scraping sessions. The scraper provides detailed logging for troubleshooting extraction failures. Image URLs (both thumbnail and high-resolution) are extracted correctly for jobs that have images.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 1   | User                 | As a user, I want to see a list of available workflows (tags) in a sidebar so I can easily navigate to orders for a specific workflow. As a user, I want to see my recently viewed orders in the sidebar so I can quickly access them again. As a user, I want to search for orders by keywords so I can find specific orders quickly. As a user, when I select a workflow, I want to see a table of all relevant orders for that workflow. As a user, I want to be able to filter the orders displayed in the workflow table by status, due date, and priority. As a user, I want to be able to reset all filters on the workflow page. As a user, I want a dropdown/selector that allows switching between workflows on the workflow page. | Agreed | A user interface is implemented with a search bar, sidebar, and main content area. The sidebar displays a list of tags from the database. The sidebar displays a list of up to 5 recently viewed orders with status indicator, order number, and main tag. Clicking a tag in the sidebar navigates to a workflow page for that tag. The workflow page displays a table of orders associated with the selected tag. The order table includes columns for Order #, Title, Status, Assigned To, Due Date, and Tags. Status and Tags in the table are visually distinct (color-coded/icons). Filters for Status, Date, and Priority are present on the workflow page. Applying filters updates the displayed orders. A "Reset" button clears all active filters. A dropdown/selector allows switching between workflows on the workflow page. The search bar allows searching orders based on text content (initially filtering the current workflow page). |

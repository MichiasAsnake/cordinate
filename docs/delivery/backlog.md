| 2   | System Administrator | As a system administrator, I want the scraping process to be reliable and resilient so that it can successfully extract data from all available jobs without browser crashes or data extraction failures. I want image data to be accurately matched to the correct job and extracted consistently. I want the scraper to handle navigation timing issues and maintain browser stability throughout the entire scraping process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Agreed | The scraper successfully extracts data from >95% of available jobs without browser crashes. Image containers are correctly matched to their corresponding job numbers using data-asset-tag attributes. The scraper handles browser timing issues and prevents premature browser closure. List data extraction succeeds consistently after navigating back from job detail pages. Error handling and recovery mechanisms are implemented for common failure scenarios. Browser memory usage is managed to prevent crashes during long scraping sessions. The scraper provides detailed logging for troubleshooting extraction failures. Image URLs (both thumbnail and high-resolution) are extracted correctly for jobs that have images.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 1   | User                 | As a user, I want to see a list of available workflows (tags) in a sidebar so I can easily navigate to orders for a specific workflow. As a user, I want to see my recently viewed orders in the sidebar so I can quickly access them again. As a user, I want to search for orders by keywords so I can find specific orders quickly. As a user, when I select a workflow, I want to see a table of all relevant orders for that workflow. As a user, I want to be able to filter the orders displayed in the workflow table by status, due date, and priority. As a user, I want to be able to reset all filters on the workflow page. As a user, I want a dropdown/selector that allows switching between workflows on the workflow page. | Agreed | A user interface is implemented with a search bar, sidebar, and main content area. The sidebar displays a list of tags from the database. The sidebar displays a list of up to 5 recently viewed orders with status indicator, order number, and main tag. Clicking a tag in the sidebar navigates to a workflow page for that tag. The workflow page displays a table of orders associated with the selected tag. The order table includes columns for Order #, Title, Status, Assigned To, Due Date, and Tags. Status and Tags in the table are visually distinct (color-coded/icons). Filters for Status, Date, and Priority are present on the workflow page. Applying filters updates the displayed orders. A "Reset" button clears all active filters. A dropdown/selector allows switching between workflows on the workflow page. The search bar allows searching orders based on text content (initially filtering the current workflow page). |
